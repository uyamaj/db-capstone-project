I cleaned the excel file: first I created a Profit column using the calculated field.
Then I split the customer names into two columns: First name and Last name

•  To create the Customer Sales:

•  I dragged the Customer Name field from the data pane to the columns section and sales field  to the rows section 

•  I dragged the Sales field from the data pane and dropped it onto the filter shelf

•  I dragged the Sales field from the data pane and dropped it onto the color mark 

•  Then I used the filter to narrow the sales value to sales >= $70




To create the profits chart:

•  I dragged the Order Date field from the data pane to the columns section and Profit field  to the rows section 

•  I dragged the Order Date field to the filter shelf

•  I dragged the order date field from the data pane and dropped it onto the color mark 

•  Then I used the filter to exclude 2023



To show the sales bubble chart:


•  I dragged the profit field from the data pane and dropped it onto the size mark

•  I dragged the sales field from the data pane and dropped it onto the tooltip mark

•  I dragged the Customer name field from the data pane and dropped it onto the color mark 

•  I dragged the customer name field from the data pane and dropped it onto the label mark


To create the Cuisine Sales & Profit chart:

•  I dragged the Cuisine name and order date fields from the data pane to the columns section and sales field  to the rows section
 
•  I dragged the order date field from the data pane and dropped it onto the color mark

•  I dragged the profit field from the data pane and dropped it onto the tooltip mark

•  I dragged the sales field from the data pane and dropped it onto the label mark

•  Then I used the filter to display sales for 2020, 2021, and 2022 

•  Lastly, I sorted the data in descending order




To create an interactive dashboard:

•  I opened the dashboard view and dragged the customer sales and sales bubble chart worksheets I created from the sheets pane to the dashboard view.
